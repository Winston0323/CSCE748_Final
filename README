I implement the panorama with manual and also RANSAC
I tried harris corner detection, you can see the image corner detected images, but I cannot calculate the correct H and combine it with the other image. Manual is working finally. 
I applied a 50:50 blending with the image and that's the reason why it is so blurry on details

(This is a tutorial for panorama python but it use too much external library, so I only kept his method of read image names)
